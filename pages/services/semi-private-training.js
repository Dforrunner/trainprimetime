            This is a small group of up to 6 people following a customized program at a deliberate pace. We keep the
            groups small to allow the trainer to provide each individual the necessary amount of coaching and
            instruction while saving you up to 60% on the cost of having a trainer. Working in a small group can add
            extra motivation, increase the level of accountability, and provide some gym camaraderie. If you are looking
            to get fit and donâ€™t mind making a couple of gym buddies along the way check out our small group training
            session.
